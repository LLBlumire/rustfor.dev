# Lesson 3: Types and Patterns

You will recall from last lesson that memory safety requires that all memory
accessed

1.  Exists
2.  Contains valid data

In the previous lesson, we looked at how move semantics are used to ensure
memory is only accessed when it exists. In this lesson, we will look at how Rust
ensures that the memory contains valid data.

In Rust, all values have exactly one type. This type defines the space a value
will take up (which is needed to allocate that space for it in memory, typically
on the stack), and which possible memory values can occupy this space.

Types are used in two main places: variable declarations, and function
signatures. I'll talk more about function signatures later in this article, but
it will be useful for you to understand simple variable declarations right away.

## Let Statements

It's time for me to formally introduce you to your first piece of Rust syntax.
I used them last lesson, but in a way that will have lulled you into a false
sense of familiarity.

```rust
let irrefutable_pattern: Type = expression;
```

You'll notice I say "irrefutable pattern" and not "variable name". Patterns are
how new variables are declared in Rust, they come in two varieties: refutable
and irrefutable. We'll talk more about refutable patterns later, but for the
time being all the patterns I introduce will be irrefutable. Lets start with
two simple patterns.

- An identifier pattern `ident` matches any value, creates a new variable and
  binds the value to the variable. Values are moved into this identifier (unless
  they have copy semantics, of course).
- The wildcard pattern `_` matches any value and ignores it.

```rust
let my_ident = 7; // `my_ident` matches `7` and binds it
let _ = 12; // `_` matches `12` and ignores it
```

It's also important to understand that you can ommit
the <code>:&nbsp;Type</code>, if Rust can infer the type from other contexts
(such as the value of the expression already having a single appropriate type).
It is typical to only write the type in a let expression if the compiler
complains at you for not doing it.

## Fixed Size Primitive Types

Now lets move onto some real types, the following is a summary of Rusts fixed
size primitive types, their size in bytes, and their legal values.

| Type    | Size | Values                                                                               |
| :------ | :--: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `!`     |  0   |                                                                                      |
| `()`    |  0   | `()`                                                                                 |
| `bool`  |  1   | `true` as `0x01`, `false` as `0x00`                                                  |
| `u8`    |  1   | Natural numbers from $0$ to $2^{8}-1$                                                |
| `i8`    |  1   | Integers from $-(2^{7})$ to $2^{7}-1$                                                |
| `u16`   |  2   | Natural numbers from $0$ to $2^{16}-1$                                               |
| `i16`   |  2   | Integers from $-(2^{15})$ to $2^{15}-1$                                              |
| `u32`   |  4   | Natural numbers from $0$ to $2^{32}-1$                                               |
| `i32`   |  4   | Integers from $-(2^{31})$ to $2^{31}-1$                                              |
| `f32`   |  4   | All IEEE 754-2008 binary32 format values (754-1985 single precision float)           |
| `char`  |  4   | Any unicode scalar value in the `0x0000` to `0xD7FF` or `0xE000` to `0x10FFFF` range |
| `u64`   |  8   | Natural numbers from $0$ to $2^{64}-1$                                               |
| `i64`   |  8   | Integers from $-(2^{63})$ to $2^{63}-1$                                              |
| `f32`   |  8   | All IEEE 754-2008 binary64 format values (754-1985 dounle precision float)           |
| `u128`  |  1   | Natural numbers from $0$ to $2^{128}-1$                                              |
| `i128`  |  1   | Integers from $-(2^{127})$ to $2^{127}-1$                                            |
| `usize` |  \*  | As per `u16`, `u32`, or `u64` depending on target platform's pointer type            |
| `isize` |  \*  | As per `i16`, `i32`, or `i64` depending on target platform's pointer type            |

_\*the `usize` and `isize` types have a platform specific size. For a 32 bit
computer they will be 4 bytes large, for a 64 bit computer they will be 8 bytes
large_

Two types above seem more odd, and not as self explanatory as the others. These
are the two with zero size. `()` is pronounced "unit" and is a type with only
one value, also called `()` "unit". This type takes up no space, as anywhere the
compiler encounters this type it can work with it without needing to store any
value (as it knows the value without storing it).

The most common place you will encounter `()` is as the return type from
functions and expressions that return no data. It is similar to `void` in other
languages.

The other type, `!`, is pronounced "never", and it cannot be constructed.
Anywhere the compiler encounters a value of this type it can assume is
unreachable code, as no value of this type exists.

The most common place you will encounter `!` is as the return type from
functions that loop infinitely and never terminate or where execution branches.

All the other types can be constructed and represented in code simply as their
numeric representation, or a character in single quotes for the `char` type.
Numeric literals can be suffixed with their type to inform the compiler of your
intention, otherwise integer literals will infer `i32` as their type, and float
literals will infer `f32` as their type.

```rust
let u = (); // `u: ()` is inferred
let b: bool = true;
let n: u8 = 56;
let p = 81u8; // `p: u8` is inferred from the expression type
let s: i8 = -9;
let i = 93; // `i: i32` is inferred
let f = 12.4; // `f: f32` by default
let c = 'z'; // `c: char` is inferred
let x = loop { }; // loops forever, `x` is never assigned to, `x: !` inferred
```

## Sequence Types

In addition to the above fixed size primitive types, Rust provided us with some
sequence types.

### Arrays

Arrays allow you to store a fixed size sequence of a type adjacent to each.
other in memory. We denote this `[T; N]`, such that `[i32; 4]` takes up 16 bytes
of memory. You can access the parts of an array through numeric indices starting
at 0.

```rust
let x = [122, -68, 70, 32]; // infers `x: [i32; 4]`
let a = x[0]; // a == 122
let b = x[1]; // b == -68
let c = x[2]; // c == 70
let d = x[3]; // d == 32
```

This now gives us a good oppertunity to talk more about three new patterns.

- Slice patterns `[comma_separated_patterns]` match arrays (and slices, more on
  them later) and destructure them.
- The rest pattern `..` matches zero or more unmatched elements in a slice
  pattern (or in a tuple or tuple struct pattern which I'll introduce later).
- The identifier pattern can be extended as `ident @ pattern` which binds the
  value a pattern matches to a variable. This can be very useful with `..`, and
  is the most common place you will see it being used.

```rust
let [a, b, c, d] = x; // a == 122, b == -68, c == 70, d == 32
let [a, bc @ .., d] = x; // a == 122, bc == [-68, 70], d == 32
let abcd @ [_, b, _, d] = x; // abcd == [122, -68, 70, 32], b == -68, d == 32
```

### Tuples

Tuples allow you to store a sequence of different types in memory, though Rust
may place padding between them or change their in memory order according to
arcane rules known as the ["default representation"][repr]. `(i32, char)` is a
sequence of a 32-bit integer and a unicode scalar character (UTF-32). You can
access the parts of a tuple through numeric field access starting at 0.

```rust
let x = (2503, 'B', 12.5); // infers `x: (i32, char, f32)`
let a = x.0; // a == 2503
let b = x.1; // b == 'B'
let c = x.2; // c == 12.5
```

Only one new pattern to learn this time

- Tuple patterns match tuple values and destructure them.

But you can use the rest pattern with a tuple!

```rust
let (a, b, c) = x; // a == 2503, b == 'B', c == 12.5
let (a, ..) = x; // a = 2503
```

### Slices

It is also possible to have a sequence of unknown size (we call these unsized),
it is not possible for Rust to reserve space for these on the stack ahead of
time. We call such a sequence a slice and it is written `[T]`. The type `[u8]`
for example is a sequence of unsigned bytes of unkown (at compile time) length.

There is one other special unsized type: `str`. This type is equivalent to
`[u8]`, however the full sequence is guaranteed to be a valid UTF-8 encoded
string.

Because they are unsized, slices cannot be placed directly inside a variable,
as the compiler does not know how much space to reserve for that variable. In
order to store these in a variable we must use indirection, and so I must now
finally talk about references.

## Reference (and Pointer) Types

Last lesson I mentioned that Rust is trying to solve both memory safety _and_
thread safety. To achieve thread safety, values must only be accessed and
modified in a way that ensures all threads behave properly. To achieve this,
Rust disallows simultaneous mutable access.

To further motivate references, consider the undesirable effect of move
semantics, that no value of a type with move semantics could be passed to a
function without either being explicitly dropped when the function ends, or
manually returned to the caller to hand back ownership.

Consider further that there would be no way for a function to modify a value
in place, regardless of if the value has move or copy semantics.

References provide indirection and are the solution to all of these issues, but
in order to ensure thread safety Rust has two reference types instead of one.

The first, `&T`, is called a reference and provides read only access. Many of
these references may coexist. Because multiple of these references to the same
value can exist, `&T` has copy semantics regardless of the semantics of `T`.
If a reference to a value exists, we say that the reference borrows the value.

The second, `&mut T`, is called a mutable reference and provides read and write
access. Only one such mutable reference to a value may exist at a time. A
mutable reference cannot coexist with an immutable reference. `&mut T` always
has move semantics (moving the reference, not the value). If a mutable reference
to a value exists, we say the mutable reference borrows the value as mutable.

You can create a reference of any value so long as that value is not borrowed as
mutable. You can create a mutable reference of any value so long as that value
is not borrowed.

A reference cannot outlive the value it borrows as this would allow a use after
free memory error, thus a value cannot be dropped while a reference to it
exists.

Because of the restrictions that references place on a value (dropping, creation
of mutable references), we say all references have a lifetime. This lifetime is
the duration for which those restrictions are applied. In some circumstances
lifetimes can be named, a lifetime named `lt` is written `&'lt ___` or
`&'lt mut ___`. One special named lifetime exists by default: `'static`.
References with this lifetime are held for the entire duration of the program
(and thus the value they point to is never dropped).

There are two possible sizes a reference can have, depending on the type of the
borrowed value. If the borrowed value is a sized type, references to it will
have the same size as `usize`, storing a pointer to the value in memory.

If the borrowed value is an unsized type, references to it will have twice the
size of `usize`, with half storing a pointer to the value in memory, and the
other half storing the size of the value. This ability for references to borrow
unsized types with a known size solves the problem from the previous section,
we cannot store a `str` or slice `[T]` directly in a variable, but we can store
a reference to them!

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: [i32; 6] = [1, 4, 65, -110, 75, 93];
    println!("How many numbers would you like? [1 to 6]");
    let y: usize = read_number();
    let z: &[i32] = &x[0..y]; // unsized slice in a variable!
    println!("Here are your numbers: {z:?}");
}

/// Function included only to make this example work,
/// please don't worry about what it's doing!
fn read_number() -> usize {
    let mut buf = String::new();
    std::io::stdin().read_line(&mut buf).unwrap();
    buf.trim().parse().unwrap()
}
```

This should help explain the string literals from our last lesson. A string
literal creates a value of the type `&'static str`. `str` because it is a valid
UTF-8 unicode string, `&'static` because the string value is written into the
binary and never dropped. Because these are an immutable reference they have
copy semantics as you saw.

Pointers, usually called "raw pointers" in Rust, exist both for interoperability
with C and to allow implementing custom types that perform their own memory
management (the standard library has many of these). These types are `*const T`
and `*mut T`. They do not have lifetimes, and do not enforce thr same
restrictions as their reference counterparts. They are easy to create from
references, but cannot be read from, written to, or converted back into
references without using the `unsafe` keyword and promising Rust that you have
upheld its memory and thread safety guarantees despite them not being enforced.

## Slices Again, and Range Syntax

Now that you know about pointers, lets circle back around to slices. They are
typically created using range syntax `a..b` and an array or similarly indexable
data structure. Ranges are a data structure in their own right (actually 6) and
are one of the worst designed things in Rust. Everybody hates them and agrees we
designed them badly. Somehow they snuck into Rust 1.0 and now we're stuck with
them for backwards compatability reasons. There are 6 ways to create a Range, 6
types that will be created, and far too little interoperability between them.

```rust
let a: std::ops::Range = 5..12; // 5 ≤ x < 12
let b: std::ops::RangeFrom = 9..; // 9 ≤ x
let c: std::ops::RangeTo = ..6; // x < 6
let d: std::ops::RangeFull = ..; // completely unbounded
let e: std::ops::RangeInclusive = 8..=16; // 8 ≤ x ≤ 16
let f: std::ops::RangeToInclusive = ..=14; // x ≤ 14
```

Ranges can be used in a few places, but the only place you will see all 6 of the
above used is in creating slices. In this context, they are used as an index to
an array, a slice, or another similar data structure (such as a `Vec`, which
we'll cover in a future lesson).

```rust
let x: [i32; 6] = [1, 4, 65, -110, 75, 93];
let y: &[i32] = &x[..]; // slice the whole of x
let z: &[i32] = &y[1..=3]; // slice the elements with indexes in the range 1 ≤ x ≤ 3
```

Slices can also be broken down using slice patterns, but you must include the
rest pattern `..` for the pattern to be irrefutable (again, we'll get to
refutable patterns eventually) because you cannot know its length.

```rust
let x: [i32; 6] = [1, 4, 65, -110, 75, 93];
let y: &[i32] = &x[..];
let [head, tail @ ..] = y; // head = 1, tail = &[4, 65, -110, 75, 93]
```

## Functional Types

When you create a function you also create a unit type representing that
function, which has a value identified by the function name. This unit value
can be assigned to a variable and called the same as one might call the
function, but the type cannot be named and must only be inferred.

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_fn = add_one;
    println!("{}", my_fn(4))
}

fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

If you do want to prescribe a type, you can coerce a function unit value into a
function pointer. This has size equivalent to `usize` instead of having zero
size like the function unit value, and it's value is the memory address where
the function is stored. Function pointer types are written `fn(params) -> ret`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_fn: fn(i32) -> i32 = add_one;
    println!("{}", my_fn(4))
}

fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

## User Defined Types

There are three kinds of user defined types: structs, enums, and unions.
Structs and enums are extremely useful. Unions exist mostly for C interop.

### Structs

There are three types of struct definition: unit structs, tuple structs, and
named field structs.

The first of the three allows custom user defined unit types. These are useful
for representing trivial state with custom implementations (more on this next
lesson).

```rust
struct MyUnitStruct;

fn main() {
    let x = MyUnitStruct;
}
```

The second of the three allows custom tuple structs, which behave like tuples
with numeric index keys and destructuring, but act as an independent type with
their own implementations.

```rust
struct MyTupleStruct(i32, char);

let x = MyTupleStruct(-16, 'L');
let a = x.0; // a == -16
let b = x.1; // b == 'L'
```

And a new pattern for destructuring it, which works exactly like the tuple
pattern but for tuple structs.

- The tuple struct pattern `TupleStruct(comma_separated_patterns)` matches
  tuple struct values and destructures them.

```rust
let MyTupleStruct(a, b) = x; // a == -16, b == 'L'
```

The final of the three, and most commonly seen, is a named field struct. It has
no equivalent primitives type, but you can think of it as a tuple with named
fields.

```rust
struct MyFieldStruct {
    my_number: i32,
    my_letter: char,
}

let x = MyFieldStruct {
    my_number: 24,
    my_letter: 'K',
};
let a = x.my_number; // a == 24
let b = x.my_letter; // b == 'K'
```

And another new pattern for destructuring it:

- The struct pattern `Struct { field: pattern, .. }` matches named field struct
  values and destructures them.

You can also use a dirty syntax hack that is designed to look like the rest
pattern but isn't actually a pattern (because you can't use the `ident @ ..`
pattern with it).

```rust
let MyFieldStruct {
    my_number: a,
    my_letter: b
} = x; // a == 24, b == 'K'
```

### Unions

In almost a decade of writing and using Rust code I have never needed a union.
If you do need them, then you're either doing C interop and already know what
you are doing, or you're wrong and should use another data structure instead.

Almost always that data structure is enums. Or it's `std::mem::transmute`.

### Enums

Enums in Rust are not like in most other languages. They can be, as you will
see, but typically they are used in a way that is significantly more poweful.

There are three types of enum in Rust: C-like enums, sum type enums, and
zero-variant enums.

C-like enums work like the enums in most languages, providing an association
between a number and a named value.

```rust
enum CLikeEnum {
    ImplicitZero, // Defaults to `= 0`
    First, // Continues as `= 1`
    Second = 2, // Explicit number
    Tenth = 10, // Can skip ahead
}

fn main() {
    let e = CLikeEnum::Second;
    let n = e as i32;
}
```

Sum type enums allow you to define a type that has multiple possible mutually
exclusive states called variants. Variants, like structs, can be unit, tuple, or
named field variants.

```rust
enum SumTypeEnum {
    MyUnitVariant,
    MyTupleVariant(i32, char),
    MyNamedFieldVariant {
        my_str: &'static str,
        my_bool: bool,
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut a: SumTypeEnum = SumTypeEnum::MyUnitVariant;
    a = SumTypeEnum::MyTupleVariant(-8, 'g');
    a = SumTypeEnum::MyNamedFieldVariant {
        my_str: "Example!",
        my_bool: true,
    };
}
```

There are also patterns that can destructure enums, but we are going to have to
talk about refutable patterns finally. Actually, technically you can use
irrefutable patterns to destructure an enum, but you have a strict condition and
a new pattern:

- Or patterns `pattern_a | pattern_b` can match either pattern. Both patterns
  must produce identical variables (in name and type).

Because of the restriction that both sides must produce the same variable in
name and type, you are quite restricted in how you can use this with enums, but
you could do the following:

```rust
enum Silly {
    HasANumber(i32, char),
    AlsoHasANumber {
        num: i32,
        float: f32,
    }
}

let x = Silly::HasANumber(12, 'c');
let (Silly::HasANumber(n, _) | Silly::AlsoHasANumber { num: n, .. }) = x;
```

Struct syntax also has a convenience to make your life easier. If you want to
bind a variable with the same name as a field, instead of doing

```rust
let Struct { field: field } = Struct { field: 12 };
```

You can instead ommit the `: field`.

```rust
let Struct { field } = Struct { field: 12 };
```

## Refutable Patterns

So far, I've only shown you irrefutable patterns. This means that the pattern
can always bind to a value provided the value is of the correct type. It is also
possible to construct patterns where the value _might_ be able to match, but it
also might not. A trivial example of this introduces a new pattern:

- Range patterns `start..end` match scalar values within their defined bounds.

```rust
let x = 8;
let bigger_than_four @ 4.. = x;
```

```text
error[E0005]: refutable pattern in local binding
 --> src/main.rs:3:9
  |
2 |     let bigger_than_four @ 4.. = x;
  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ pattern `i32::MIN..=3_i32` not covered
```

Ah fun, a compiler error. You can see the error is quite elegantly explaiend
though. Even though we know that our `x` in this instance is bigger than 4, the
compiler has no guaruntees that `x` is bigger than four, and so there is no
coverage of the case where `x` is between the smallest possible `i32`, and 3.

There are two new syntax elements we can use to resolve this.

### If Let Expressions

An if let statement has the following form:

```rust
if let refutable_pattern = expression {
    /* block contents */
} else {
    /* block contents */
}
```

The else block is optional.

This allows us to do the following:

```rust
let x = 8;
if let 4.. = x {
    println!("The number {x} was equal to or bigger than four!");
} else {
    println!("The number {x} was smaller than four");
}
```

Obviously this is a contrived example, and you shouldn't actually do that, you
would just do `if x >= 4 {}` in real code, but you _can_ do it with pattern
matching instead if you want to make your colleagues hate you.

A more useful example of this syntax comes from using struct and tuple struct
patterns to break down a refutable enum.

```rust
enum IntOrFloat {
    Num(i32),
    Float {
        f: f32,
    }
}

let x = IntOrFloat::Num(12);

if let IntOrFloat::Float { f } = x {
    println!("We have a float: {f}!");
} else if let IntOrFloat::Num(n) = x {
    println!("We have an integer: {n}!");
}
```

Also note that If Lets are expressions and not statements, this means you can
use them in an expression position, and they will evaluate to the last
expression in the appropriate block.

```rust
let my_float = if let IntOrFloat::Float { f } = x {
    println!("We have a float: {f}!");
    f
} else if let IntOrFloat::Num(n) = x {
    return Error(format!("We have an integer: {n}! That's bad!"));
};
```

### Let Else Statements

Sometimes, you are fairly confident the refutable pattern will be a certain
form, or you otherwise simply want to return an error if a value does not match
the pattern you expect it to. In this instance you can use a let else statement.

```rust
let refutable_pattern = expression else {
    /* block */
}
```

This makes writing the above error handling with our float much simpler! Though
we do lose the ability to use else if and destructure the alternative case.

```rust
let IntOrFloat::Float { f } = x else {
    return Error(format!("We have an integer, That's bad!"));
}
println!("We have a float: {f}!");
```

### Match Expressions

Match expressions are great when you want to handle all the possible cases, and
are a lot less cumbersome than using if let else if let for the equivalent,
especially when you have many possible cases to provide a pattern for.

```rust
match expression {
    pattern_a => expression_a,
    patterb_b => expression_b,
    ...
}
```

For example, replicating our expression from earlier.

```rust
let my_float = match x {
    IntOrFloat::Float { f } => {
        println!("We have a float: {f}!");
        f
    },
    IntOrFloat::Num(n) => {
        return Error(format!("We have an integer: {n}! That's bad!"));
    }
};
```

## Generics

User defined types can have generic type parameters. These allow for types
inside the UDT to be defined by the user of the UDT, rather than by the UDT
itself.

```rust
struct MyDataStruct<T> {
    my_num: i32,
    my_data: T,
}
enum Choice<A, B> {
    First(A),
    Second(B),
    Neither,
    Both {
        first: A,
        second: B
    }
}
fn main() {
    let x: MyDataStruct<char> = MyDataStruct {
        my_num: 17,
        my_data: 'G',
    };
    let y: Choice<f64, MyDataStruct<char>> = Choice::Second(x);
}
```

In the above, `Choice<f64, MyDataStruct<char>>` essentially creates the
following type:

```rust
struct MyDataStruct<char> {
    my_num: i32,
    my_data: char,
}
enum Choice<f64, MyDataStruct<char>> {
    First(f64),
    Second(MyDataStruct<char>),
    Neither,
    Both {
        first: f64,
        second: MyDataStruct<char>,
    }
}
```

User defined types can also have generic lifetimes. This allows them to store
references.

```rust
struct HoldsAReference<'a> {
    ref_to_number: &'a i32,
}
```

If the number is static, you will have a `HoldsAReference<'static>`. If it has
some other lifetime (which are almost always anonymous), then you will have a
`HoldsAReference<'some_unnamed_anonymous_lifetime>`.
