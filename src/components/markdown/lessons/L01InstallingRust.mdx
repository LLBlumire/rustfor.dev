# Lesson 1: Installing Rust

There are three main pieces of software that are needed for developing Rust code.

- `rustc` is the Rust language compiler. It turns `.rs` files into executables.
- `cargo` is the Rust package manager. It downloads library dependencies and can
  call `rustc` for you.
- `rustup` is the rust toolchain manager, it installs the above components for
  you, keeps them up to date, and can dynamically change your toolchain version
  to comply with the version requirements of the project you are building.

Those are mandatory to have a good development experience, but you probably also
want the following.

- `rustfmt` formats your code to comply with the format used by the standard
  library. You can customise this format, but for the sake of everyone who has
  to read your code please don't.
- `rust-analyzer` is the Rust language server. This is used by your editor of
  choice to provide you with inlay hints, error messages, code navigation, and
  many other quality of life improvements.
- `clippy` is a linter which can check your code for common bad practice
  and likely errors. It is significantly more useful than the paperclip it is
  named after.

Fortunately, all of these tools can be installed by `rustup`, so you only need
to install that and the rest can be bootstrapped from there.

You can install this from your system package manager of choice, or you can
follow the instructions on https://rustup.rs for your system.

If you are using windows, I strongly recommend you install a WSL2 distribution
and use that instead. I'm sure you can use google to figure out how to do this.
Most WSL users are using [Ubuntu][wslu], I personally quite like [Fedora][wslf].

Once you have rustup installed, you will need to chose a toolchain version to
load. I recommend you set your system default toolchain with:

```
rustup default stable
```

Alternatively, you can create a `rust-toolchain.toml` in your project directory
to specific a toolchain which will overwrite the system default chain for
commands run in that directory.

```toml
# rust-toolchain.toml

[toolchain]
channel = "1.70.0"
components = [ "rust-analyzer" ]
```

If you are using Nix for reproducibility, which you should be if you're a
company, have a look at [this example flake][rsnix]
you can see more examples or learn about Nix on https://zero-to-nix.com/.
