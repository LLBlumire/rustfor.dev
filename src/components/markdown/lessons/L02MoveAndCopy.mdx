# Lesson 2: Move and Copy

It is time for us to begin exploring the theory behind Rust, and what makes it
tic.

The first thing to understand is the two problems that Rust solves.

 1. Memory safety
 2. Thread safety

These are two classes of error entirely presented by Rust design, and are
significant problems to try and solve. Errors in these domains make up a huge
share of some of the security vulnerabilities and major errors that have plagued
software. Many errors would be prevented by Rusts language design, including but 
not limited to:

 - OpenSSL Heartbleed
 - NetUSB run_init_netbus
 - SecureTransfer goto fail
 - GNUTLS goto cleanup
 - SChannel Winshock
 - JCE Bleichenbacher Attack
 - glibc gethostby (GHOST)

Now we've established that Rust is important, let's talk about the first step it
takes to achieve this.

The following is not Rust code you can compile, because im focusing on concepts
not concretes, but consider the following.

```
function print_string(s) {
    /* internals hidden */
}

function main() {
    let my_string = "Hello";
    print_string(my_string);
    print_string(my_string);
}
```

What would you expect the above code to do. For many languages the answer is
"print Hello twice". Rust takes the more controversial answer of "not
compiling". The following is an approximation of the error you would see if the
above was real rust code.

```
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `my_string`
 --> src/main.rs:8:18
  |
6 |     let my_string = "Hello";
  |         --------- move occurs because `my_string` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
7 |     print_string(my_string);
  |                  --------- value moved here
8 |     print_string(my_string);
  |                  ^^^^^^^^^ value used here after move
  |
```

This is because of the first and most critical thing to understand about Rust:
move semantics.

One of the steps Rust must take to ensure memory safety is to know exactly when
every piece of data is destroyed. If you attempt to use memory after your
program releases it to the operating system, you create a "use after free",
this is undefined behaviour and may cause [nasal demons][ub].

In order to ensure memory safety, the Rust compiler meticulously tracks and
enforces when all memory is acquired and released, when all values are created
and destroyed.

In Rust, values are dropped (and memory is released) when they go out of scope.
This creates the natural follow up question of "what is a scope?" and "what
scope is a value in?".

## What is a scope?

Scopes, tautologically for the purpose of our explanation here, are simply
"the part of the code where one can access a variable". Practically, the
question we must therefore ask is "what constrains a scope?".

## What constrains a scope? A.K.A. what scope is a value in?

Variables have their scope constrained to a "block". A block is a collection of
statements enclosed by braces. In the example I gave earlier, there are two
blocks, one for the `main` function, and one for the `print_string` function.

In real Rust code, you can create blocks anywhere you like by sprinkling `{}`
around the statements you want in the block. We aren't writing real Rust code
yet though, so let's not worry about that yet.

## Move Semantics

So, values are in scope from when they are created, and in scope until the block
they were created in ends. This doesn't answer why our code from earlier will
refuse to compile though, as it would imply that the `"Hello"` value should be
in scope until the end of `main`.

However, this value is used inside the `print_string` function, so the value
must also be available inside this functions block. Many languages would choose
to make a copy of the data, duplicating it in memory, and making the duplicate
available in the function (pass by value). Others might choose to use
indirection and have the `"Hello"` value be allocated in some other location,
and give both `main` and `print_string` access to this indirection (pass by
reference). Rust chooses neither of these approaches, and uses "pass by move"
instead. When a function call occurs, parameters are moved into the scope
(block) of the function being called. This reveals why the above code is
rejected in Rust.

When `my_string` is passed to `print_string`, `"Hello"` is moved from the block
created by the `main` function into the block created by the `print_string`
function (and is now named `s`). Then, when that first `print_string` function
ends and the parameter `s` goes out of scope the value `"Hello"` is released and
destroyed. This means that `"Hello"` no longer exists to he passed to the second
`print_string` call.

Hopefully that error message should make more sense now.

You are probably now thinking something along the lines of "Rust is really
inconvenient because it doesn't let me use any values twice", but the above
isn't the whole story.

## Copy Semantics

Move semantics aren't the only way values are used in Rust. Values which perform
no large memory allocation and require no cleanup, such as many of Rust's 
primitive types. If the code example was the following, for example:

```
function print_number(n) {
    /* internals hidden */
}

function main() {
    let my_number = 7;
    print_number(my_number);
    print_number(my_number);
}
```

Then the code would actually compile, and output:

```
7
7
```

You can tell if a value will use copy semantics instead of move semantics if the
type of the value implements the `Copy` trait, but those are Rust things I've
not explained yetâ€”so just trust me that you never really run into issues knowing
if a value will move or copy.

In general, a value will copy instead of move if it performs no allocations
external to the type itself. A number just takes up the space defined by its 
type, for example `i32` takes up 32 bytes, so it will use copy semantics. A type
like `String` does need an external allocation, as the type itself cannot know 
how long the text will be, so it uses move semantics.

## What about strings though?

It would still be inconvenient for strings to have move semantics. They are a
common data type and so it would be nice if Rust could give us a solution to 
this. Fortunately, it does have a solution. When you define a string literal,
instead of the value being allocated and destroy as one would expect for
something with move semantics, the text is embeded directly into the output
binary and never deallocates. This allows the string to behave with copy
semantics, as instead of moving around the string we can copy around a reference
to the string. In this way, string literals become pass by (static) reference,
and avoid the complexity of move semantics.

This is why the first sample I gave isn't real Rust code. If it was it wouldn't
have nicely illustrated move semantics. The following examples show real rust
code equivalents of the samples in this article, followed by their outputs when
attempting to compile and run them.

## Real Rust Examples

### Example 1: moving strings

```rust
fn print_string(s: String) {
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn main() {
    let my_string = String::from("Hello"); // String::from gives move semantics
    print_string(my_string);
    print_string(my_string);
}
```

Outputs
