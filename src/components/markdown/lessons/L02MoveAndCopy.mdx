# Lesson 2: Move and Copy

It is time for us to begin exploring the theory behind Rust, and what makes it
tick.

The first thing to understand is the two problems that Rust solves.

 1. Memory safety
 2. Thread safety

These are two classes of error entirely prevented by Rust design, and are
significant problems to try and solve. Errors in these domains make up a huge
share of the security vulnerabilities and major errors that have plagued
software. Many errors would be prevented by Rusts language design, including but 
not limited to:

 - OpenSSL Heartbleed
 - NetUSB run_init_netbus
 - SecureTransfer goto fail
 - GNUTLS goto cleanup
 - SChannel Winshock
 - JCE Bleichenbacher Attack
 - glibc gethostby (GHOST)

To begin solving these, we will first address memory safety. This is, at a high
level, ensuring that all memory accessed

 1. Exists
 2. Contains valid data
 
To address this lets start with an example: the following is not Rust code you
can compile, because im focusing on concepts not concretes, but consider the
following.

```js
function print_string(s) {
    /* internals hidden */
}

function main() {
    let my_string = "Hello";
    print_string(my_string);
    print_string(my_string);
}
```

What would you expect the above code to do. For many languages the answer is
"print Hello twice". Rust takes the more controversial answer of "not
compiling". The following is an approximation of the error you would see if the
above was real rust code.

```text
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `my_string`
 --> src/main.rs:8:18
  |
6 |     let my_string = "Hello";
  |         --------- move occurs because `my_string` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
7 |     print_string(my_string);
  |                  --------- value moved here
8 |     print_string(my_string);
  |                  ^^^^^^^^^ value used here after move
  |
```

This is because of the first and most critical thing to understand about Rust:
move semantics.

One of the steps Rust must take to ensure memory safety is to know exactly when
every piece of data is destroyed. If you attempt to use memory after your
program releases it to the operating system you create a "use after free",
this is undefined behaviour and may cause [nasal demons][ub].

In order to ensure memory safety the Rust compiler meticulously tracks and
enforces when all memory is acquired and released, when all values are created
and destroyed.

 - In Rust all values have a scope.
 - Values are destroyed (and any memory they use is freed) when they go out of
   scope.
 - All values have an owner.
 - Values go out of scope when their owner goes out of scope.
 - The default owner of a value in a variable is the block the variable was
   declared in.
 - A block is a collection of statements enclosed by braces.
 - A block goes out of scope when it ends (`}`).
 
In the example I gave earlier, there are two blocks, one for the `main`
function, and one for the `print_string` function.

In real Rust code, you can create blocks anywhere you like by sprinkling `{}`
around the statements you want in the block. We aren't writing real Rust code
yet though, so let's not worry about that yet.

## Move Semantics

So, values are in scope from when they are created, and in scope until the block
they were created in ends. This doesn't answer why our code from earlier will
refuse to compile though, as it would imply that the `"Hello"` value should be
in scope until the end of `main`.

However this value is used inside the `print_string` function, so the value
must also be available inside that functions block. There are two approaches
most languages take to solving this problem:

Some languages would choose to make a copy of the data, duplicating it in
memory, and making the duplicate available in the function. This is called pass
by value and may look something like this:

```js
function print_string(s) {
    /* internals hidden */
}

function main() {
    let my_string = "Hello";
    let my_string_copy0 = copy(my_string);
    print_string(my_string_copy0);
    let my_string_copy1 = copy(my_string);
    print_string(my_string_copy1);
}
```

Others might choose to use indirection and have the `"Hello"` value be allocated
in some other location and then give both `main` and `print_string` access to
this indirection, this is called pass by reference and may look something like
this:

```js
function print_string(s) {
    /* internals hidden */
}

function main() {
    let my_string_ref = allocate("Hello");
    let my_string_ref0 = copy(my_string_ref);
    print_string(my_string_ref0);
    let my_string_ref1 = copy(my_string_ref);
    print_string(my_string_ref1);
}
```

Rust chooses neither of these approaches, and uses "pass by move"
instead. When a function call occurs, parameters are moved into the scope
(block) of the function being called. We say the function being called "takes
ownership" of the values. This reveals why the example code is rejected in Rust.

When `my_string` is passed to `print_string`, `"Hello"` is moved from the block
created by the `main` function into the block created by the `print_string`
function (and is now named `s`). Then, when that first `print_string` function
ends and the parameter `s` goes out of scope, the value `"Hello"` is released
and destroyed. This means that `"Hello"` no longer exists to be passed to the
second `print_string` call.

Hopefully the error message should make more sense now.

You are probably now thinking something along the lines of "Rust is really
inconvenient because it doesn't let me use any values twice", but the above
isn't the whole story.

## Copy Semantics

Move semantics aren't the only way values are used in Rust. Values which perform
no large memory allocation and require no complex cleanup, such as many of
Rust's  primitive types, use copy semantics. This makes them pass by value.
If the first example used a number, for example:

```js
function print_number(n) {
    /* internals hidden */
}

function main() {
    let my_number = 7;
    print_number(my_number);
    print_number(my_number);
}
```

Then the code would actually compile, and output:

```text
7
7
```

You can tell if a value will use copy semantics instead of move semantics if the
type of the value implements the `Copy` trait, but those are Rust things I've
not explained yetâ€”so just trust me that you never really run into issues knowing
if a value will move or copy.

In general, a value will copy instead of move if it performs no allocations
external to the type itself. A number just takes up the space defined by its 
type, for example `i32` takes up 32 bits so it will use copy semantics. A type
like `String` does need an external allocation as the type itself cannot know 
how long the text will be, so it uses move semantics.

## What about strings though?

It would still be inconvenient for strings to have move semantics. They are a
common data type and so it would be nice if Rust could give us a solution to 
this.

Fortunately, it does have a solution. When you define a string literal,
instead of the value being allocated and destroyed as one would expect for
something with move semantics, the text is embeded directly into the output
binary and never deallocates. This allows the string to behave with copy
semantics, as instead of moving around the string we can copy around a reference
to the string. In this way, string literals become pass by (static) reference,
and avoid the complexity of move semantics.

This is why the first sample I gave isn't real Rust code. If it was it wouldn't
have nicely illustrated move semantics. The following examples show real rust
code equivalents of the samples in this article, followed by their outputs when
attempting to compile and run them.

## Real Rust Examples

In these examples, so thay you can compile them yourself, I have unhidden the
implementation of `print_{string,number}`. Do not worry about `println!` for 
now, as to understand it fully requires understanding macro variadics,
borrowing, and reference coercion. For now, understand that `println!("{}", x)`
will invoke the necessary operating system machinery to print the value of `x`.

If you wish to compile and run them yourself, use

```text
cargo new example
```

to create an empty Rust project in the `example/` directory. Then copy the
example code into `src/main.rs`. After this, run the example with

```text
cargo run
```

### Example 1: moving strings

```rust
fn print_string(s: String) {
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn main() {
    let my_string = String::from("Hello"); // String::from gives move semantics
    print_string(my_string);
    print_string(my_string);
}
```

In this example, `String::from` is used to force Rust to perform an allocation
at run time and give us a type with move semantics (`String` instead of `&str`,
you'll learn more about these types in the next lesson).
