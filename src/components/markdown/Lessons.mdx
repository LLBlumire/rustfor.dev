# Lessons

Lessons are designed to be completed chronologically, each builds off of the
material presented previously, and none present material not yet explained.

You may find some of the early lessons quite theory heavy. I ensure you this is
essential to actually writing Rust code, and understanding the fundamentals well
will help you immensely when progressing through later concepts.
