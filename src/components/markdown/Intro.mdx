There are a lot of resources on the internet that aim to help people learn Rust.

This is a good thing, because Rust is notoriously hard to learn.

This guide is written based on [my][me] own experiences teaching Rust since
2015: in academic contexts as a private tutor, and in commercial contexts
training existing teams to write and maintain Rust code.

I've gotten pretty good at teaching it.

This website aims to provide a guided course, not for beginners, but for mid and
senior level engineers who already know a handful of languages. If your company
is adopting Rust, and you want to be able to help fix bugs and do code reviews,
this is the guide for you.

It's not aimed at getting you writing enterprise grade software from scratch,
but it will give you a jumping off point if that is something you want to do.

This is also a highly opinionated guide, and I wont be telling you when
something is only my opinion. I'm employing my own teaching style, which is fast
paced and to the point. Not everyone will like that, and that's okay.

If you're an individual developer trying to learn, hi! If you're a company or
senior level sending your juniors and mids here so they can keep up with the
Rust code you are writing, could you [please throw some money my way][ghs]?
